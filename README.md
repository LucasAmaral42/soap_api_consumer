## SOAP API CONSUMER

This repo was created to learn and study how to consume SOAP APIs that I found on [Public SOAP APIs](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/8854915/Szf26WHn#b5484d66-c914-41ea-84a2-7604e17f9996).

If you want to see how to consume in Ruby using `savon` gem, there's a few examples.

### Useful links when using savon

* [Savon GitHub](https://github.com/savonrb/savon)
* [Savon docs](https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/savon/0.7.9)
* [Savon globals config](https://www.savonrb.com/version2/globals.html), **useful to config when creating a client.**
